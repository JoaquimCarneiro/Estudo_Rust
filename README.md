# Getting started with Rust programming language

## About this

This git repository is simply my personal notes, as I introduce my self to the Rust programming language.

## Installing Rust

### Official installer (Linux / macOS)

If you are using Linux or macOS you can use the official installer using a terminal and curl:

` curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`

### Linux

As always you should use you package manager to install software:

##### Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

`sudo apt install rust`

##### Archlinux 

` sudo pacman -S rust`

### macOS

Rust can also be installed by using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) in a terminal:

` brew install rust`

### Windows

User of windows should already know how to install software... ❤️😚

### The linker

Rust also needs a linker in Linux and macOS. In Linux this can be achieved by installing a C compiler like GCC or Clang. In macOS a C compiler can be obtained by using xcode in a terminal:

`xcode-select --install`
